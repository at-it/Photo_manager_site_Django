## Further developments needed:

- Implementation of the dominant color solution
- Performance improvement of loading images from website to database (asynchronous adding of the width/height once database is loaded?)
- Organize 'views.py' a little bit better to refactor methods
- Improve read.html django template
- Get the dominant color in hex
- Reset ID field?

## Assumptions:
- Initialization of the database pulls only 30 photos due to demo nature of this app
