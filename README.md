## Further developments needed:

- Implementation of the dominant color solution
- During load of the 5000 photos from example site, add script to show loading - this is really slow currently
- Organize 'views.py' a little bit better to refactor methods
- Improve read.html django template
- Get the dominant color in hex

## Assumptions:

- Initialization of the database pulls only 10 photos due to demo nature of this app
